# Typescript

DeerX is developed mainly using Typescript, which is a superset of the Javascript programing language infused with static type check. You can learn more about those language using the following introduction videos. Watch the introduction videos in the order below, feel free to google any terminology in those video that you don't fully understand (feel free to message me).
