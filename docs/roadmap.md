# Roadmap

This documentation contains roadmap of DeerX's mobile application future plans and upcoming updates.

# Code Refactor

This codebase is written by a small team of college students with little experience in software engineering that also moved fast and break things to get an MVP out ASAP. We are working hard to refactor code into a better folder structure, stick to a consistent design pattern, implement more unit tests, stricter linter rules to ensure contributions stick strictly to code style guidelines.

# Repository Setup

We are working hard to setup documentations for new-comers to easly contribute. We also want to setup better CI/CD pipelines that run test, code coverage, lint code. Work on this repo readme to be more catchy (add gifs, icons, badges). Maybe consider adding donation using OpenCollective?
